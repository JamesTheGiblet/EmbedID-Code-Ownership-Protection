# üìå Overview

**EmbedID** is a lightweight cryptographic tool designed to embed ownership signatures directly into source code. By using a combination of **comment-based, invisible encoding, and encryption-based ciphers**, EmbedID provides developers with a reliable way to **verify code authenticity** and **protect their intellectual property** without impacting the code's functionality. This makes it an ideal solution for safeguarding your work against plagiarism and unauthorized use.

## üî• Key Features Explained

* **Signature Embedding**: This is the core function of EmbedID. It allows you to embed a unique cryptographic marker, or signature, into your source files. This signature acts as a digital watermark, linking the code to you as the original owner.
* **Signature Verification**: The tool provides a system to confirm whether a specific signature exists within a file. This is crucial for proving ownership if your code is found in another project.
* **Multiple Cipher Methods**:
  * **Comment-Based Marking**: This method is simple and visible. It embeds your signature in a standard code comment, making it easily readable but also easy for others to remove. It's a great option for public-facing code where transparency is key.
  * **Invisible Character Encoding**: This is a more subtle method. It uses **zero-width spaces** (characters that have no width and are invisible to the human eye) to hide the signature within the code's whitespace. This makes the signature difficult to detect and remove without specific tools.
  * **Vigen√®re Cipher**: This method adds a layer of encryption to your signature, hiding it within a comment block using a simple substitution cipher. This makes the signature more secure than a simple comment and requires a key to decrypt.
* **Automated Testing Suite**: A comprehensive `pytest` suite is included to ensure the reliability and security of the tool. It validates all cipher methods and edge cases, guaranteeing the embedding and verification processes work as expected.
* **Flask Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface simplifies the process. You can upload files and manage signatures with a few clicks, making the tool accessible to developers who prefer not to use the command line.

## üèóÔ∏è Detailed Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**

To get started with EmbedID, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.10+**: We recommend using the latest stable version of Python for optimal performance.
* **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### **Getting the Source Code**

First, clone the EmbedID repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EmbedID.git
cd EmbedID
```

### **Installing Dependencies**

All required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Running the Web Interface**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the **Flask web application**. This will start a local server that hosts the user interface.

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see a message indicating the server is running. Open your web browser and navigate to **`http://127.0.0.1:5000`** to access the EmbedID interface.

### **Running Automated Tests**

Before using the tool for a critical project, it's a good practice to run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly. From the root directory of the project, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command will run all the unit tests and report on the status of each.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

### **Method 1: Using the Flask Web Interface**

This is the most straightforward way to use EmbedID.

1. **Open the Interface**: Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.
2. **Embed a Signature**:
      * On the embed form, enter your desired **signature text** (e.g., "Copyright 2025 by John Doe").
      * Select the **cipher method** you want to use (e.g., `invisible_cipher`).
      * Upload the source code file you want to protect.
      * Click **Embed**. A new file will be downloaded with your signature embedded.
3. **Verify a Signature**:
      * On the verification form, enter the exact **signature text** you want to verify.
      * Select the same **cipher method** that was used to embed the signature.
      * Upload the file you want to check.
      * Click **Verify**. The system will tell you if the signature exists and is valid.

### **Method 2: Using as a Python Module**

For integrating EmbedID into your own scripts or build processes, you can use its functions directly. The main functions are `embed` and `verify`, which are managed by `ciphers_manager.py`.

Here‚Äôs an example:

```python
# Import the necessary functions
from ciphers_manager import embed, verify

# Sample code content
file_content = "def hello():\n    print('Hello, world!')"
signature = "MyCompany-2025-TeamAlpha"
cipher_method = "invisible"  # Choose from "comment", "invisible", or "vigenere"

# Embed the signature into the code
embedded_content = embed(cipher_method, signature, file_content)
print("--- Embedded Content ---")
print(embedded_content)

# Verify if the signature exists in the embedded content
is_valid = verify(cipher_method, signature, embedded_content)
print(f"\nSignature is valid: {is_valid}")
```

## üöÄ Roadmap and Future Enhancements

We are committed to continuously improving EmbedID. Here are some of the planned enhancements:

* **AES Encryption**: The current Vigen√®re cipher is a basic step. We plan to integrate **AES encryption** to provide a much stronger, industry-standard level of security for signatures.
* **Git Integration**: A planned feature is a **Git hook** that would automatically embed a signature into new commits or specific file types, creating an automated and seamless ownership tracking system.
* **UI/UX Improvements**: We aim to enhance the web interface with real-time feedback, a visual representation of where the signature is embedded (for comment-based methods), and more streamlined workflows.
