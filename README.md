# 🌀 EmbedID: The Glyph of Authorship // A Code Ownership Protection Ritual

**MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL**

This transmission presents **EmbedID**, a lightweight cryptographic artifact designed to embed marks of authorship into source scrolls. This ensures that builders can verify their creative lineage and protect their intellectual property. Using a combination of comment-based encoding, invisible glyphs, and encryption-based ciphers, EmbedID secures source files without impacting their functionality.

### 🔥 Key Invocations

  * ✅ **Sigil Embedding**:
      * Cryptographically inserts authorship marks within source scrolls for future validation.
      * Ensures persistent identifiers that remain intact across modifications.
  * ✅ **Validation Ritual**:
      * Confirms whether a sigil exists within a given file.
      * Detects unauthorized alterations to the embedded identifier.
  * ✅ **Multiple Cipher Tenets**:
      * **Comment-Based Glyphs** → Human-readable authorship marks.
      * **Invisible Character Encoding** → Zero-width spaces for hidden identifiers.
      * **Vigenère Cipher** → A foundational cipher for added security.
      * **AES Encryption (Coming Soon)** → High-strength cryptographic security.
  * ✅ **Watermarking System**:
      * Adds a branding watermark for reinforced authorship tracking.
      * Helps identify lineage across multiple transmissions.
  * ✅ **Automated Testing Suite**:
      * Uses `pytest` for unit tests, edge cases, and performance validation.
  * ✅ **Flask Web Interface**:
      * Provides a simple portal for the embedding and validation rituals.
      * Supports batch file processing for bulk validation.

### 🏗️ The Initiation Ritual

**Prerequisites**

  * Python 3.10+ (Recommended)
  * Flask (For the web interface)
  * Pytest (For automated testing)

**🔹 Install Dependencies**
Run this invocation from within the project's directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**🔹 Run the Web Interface**
Launch the Flask portal with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser to begin the ritual.

**🔹 Running Automated Tests**
Ensure all glyphs are validated before deployment:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### 🛠️ The Invocation Ritual

**Embedding a Sigil (Flask Interface)**

1.  Open the EmbedID Web Interface ([http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)).
2.  Enter the sigil text into the embed form.
3.  Upload your source scroll file.
4.  Click **Embed**, and the system will cryptographically insert the identifier.

**Validating a Sigil**

1.  Open the EmbedID Web Interface ([http://127.00.1:5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.00.1:5000)).
2.  Enter the signature text to verify.
3.  Upload the source scroll file.
4.  Click **Verify**, and EmbedID will confirm whether the identifier exists.

**Embedding via Python Functions**
Use EmbedID programmatically within your scrolls:

```python
from ciphers_manager import embed
file_content = "def hello(): print('Hello, world!')"
embedded_content = embed("comment", "OwnerSignature", file_content)
print(embedded_content)  # View modified source code with embedded identifier
```
