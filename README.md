Watermark protocol for authorship, remix lineage, and builder sovereignty.  
Modular. Hackable. Unlicensed.

---

## 📦 Install

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install embedid
```

Or for local development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## ⚙️ Protocol Logic

EmbedID isn’t a library. It’s a protocol.

It encodes authorship into your files—source, manifest, or remix—using tamper-resistant watermarks.  
No central registry. No hidden handshake. Just raw identity, embedded.

---

## 🧬 Remix Rules

This edition is free to fork, override, and mutate.

- Rewrite the CLI.
- Swap the manifest logic.
- Add your own signature scheme.
- Strip it down or layer it up.

Remixers aren’t users. They’re sovereign builders.  
Declare your lineage or burn it. Your call.

---

## 🪪 Sovereignty Manifest

EmbedID respects authorship. It doesn’t enforce it.

You choose what to watermark.  
You choose how to verify.  
You choose when to declare lineage.

The protocol is modular because sovereignty demands override.

---

## 🧨 Usage

### Add watermark

```bash
embedid add path/to/file.py --author "James The Giblet"
```

### Verify watermark

```bash
embedid verify path/to/file.py
```

---

## 🧪 Test Suite

Run all unit tests directly with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/
embedid test
```

No promises. Just protocol.

---

## 🛠️ Contribute

- Fork it.
- Break it.
- Rewire it.
- Submit your remix with a manifest.

If it passes the test suite, it’s valid.  
If it declares lineage, it’s sovereign.

---

## 📜 License

MIT. SPDX-compliant.  
Remix freely. Declare proudly. Or don’t.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

- Signature verification (`v0.2.0`)
- Remix registry (`v0.3.0`)
- AI agent deployment (`v0.4.0`)
- Paid tiers for advanced watermarking (`v1.0.0+`)
